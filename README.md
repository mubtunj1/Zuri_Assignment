Create a new Django project named “songcrud” and create an app in the project called “musicapp”. Your project must contain a requirements.txt file housing all the pinned dependencies from your project.



We would be building a simple song CRUD application. In our models.py file inside the “musicapp” application we created, you are expected to add the following Models and Attributes.

 
n
Model: Artiste, Song, Lyric
Attributes for “Artiste” : first_name, last_name, age
Attributes for “Song” : title, date released, likes, artiste_id
Attributes for “Lyric”: content, song_id
